<i>Speed-up airphoto digitising by parallelising flatbed photo-scanners!</i>
</h3>

<br>

GeSSA is a software working on Linux computers allowing users to control several flatbed scanners at the same time and performed parallelised scanning. This software has been develop with the unique idea of speeding-up the process of digitising paper-format historical aerial photographs to preserve their content and exploit them for scientific research.  

There are two versions of GeSSA:  
- **GeSSA:** Regular version of the software with options to scan paper, glass plate and film media.
- **GeSSA Lite:** simplified version of the software solely dedicated to paper photos. This version is compatible with scanners with less scanning options, such as A3 scanners.
